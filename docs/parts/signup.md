# Part 1: Setup an Equinix Metal Account

One of the quickest way to get started on Equinix Metal is to be invited into an existing organization. Let's do just that. In this part you'll be invited into an organization; you'll sign up for a new account; and you'll login with your new credentials.

## Steps

### 1. Accept the invitation

Check your inbox. You'll receive an email requesting that you join an organization on Equinix Metal. Click on **Accept invitation**.

Fill in your first name, last name, email address, and a password. Click on **Create account**.

!!! tip

    * Your password needs to be at least 14 characters long.
    * You'll be using your password soon, don't forget it!
    * Note to **Equinix employees**, this will be a different set of credentials than your SSO.
